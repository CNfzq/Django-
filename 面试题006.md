## 面试题006:

### Redis数据库中有哪几种数据类型呢？

- [string](https://redis.io/commands#string)
- [list](https://redis.io/commands#list)
- hash
- set
- sorted set
- HyperLogLog
- Geo



the one thing you should consider first is what data types natively supported by Redis fit your scenario best. 

another thing you need to think about is whether the operations of a certain data type in Redis can satisfy your business requirements.
